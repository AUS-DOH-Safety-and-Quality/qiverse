# qiverse.azure

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental) [![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/qiverse.azure)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qiverse.azure) [![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/AUS-DOH-Safety-and-Quality/qiverse.azure/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AUS-DOH-Safety-and-Quality/qiverse.azure/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of qiverse.azure is to provide a useful all-in-one package for Azure access methods and other tools in the Microsoft ecosystem. This includes the ability to create Azure Access Tokens, and apply this to PowerBI, SharePoint and Snowflake.

## Installation

<!-- Before installing the development version of `qiverse.azure`, add a Github personal access token to R by: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- #Go to github page to generate token -->
<!-- usethis::create_github_token() -->

<!-- #paste your PAT into pop-up that follows... -->
<!-- credentials::set_github_pat() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- These credentials will now allow you to download private repositories from the AUS-DOH-Safety-and-Quality organisation. -->

<!-- You can now install the development version of `qiverse.azure` like so: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("AUS-DOH-Safety-and-Quality/qiverse.azure") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Branches of the development version of `qiverse.azure` can also be installed through the "ref" option: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("AUS-DOH-Safety-and-Quality/qiverse.azure", ref = "branch-a") -->
<!-- ``` --> 
<!-- I just realised that this whole section throughout all packages is now superfluous. If the package is released into a public repo, there will be no need for PATs to get the development version. -->

### Setting up your .Renviron

In order to enjoy the full functionality of the SharePoint, PowerBI and Snowflake connectivity features, you must have your environment variables set up correctly in R. This step only needs to be completed once. Modify your .Renviron file by entering the following command in R:

``` r
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

For internal users from HQIU, you can use [this sharepoint text file](https://wahealthdept.sharepoint.com/:t:/r/sites/SafetyandQualityIndicatorSetSQuIS/internal/SQuIS%20O365%20Confidential%20Documents/R/connectivity/example_renviron.txt) as a template. Please replace your he number and local github path with your unique information.

Save the .Renviron file, and restart your R session. Your envrionment variables are now set.

## Package Vignettes

The rendered package vignettes can be viewed after installation in R using the following command:

``` r
browseVignettes("qiverse.azure")
```
