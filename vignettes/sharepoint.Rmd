The series of functions in qiverse.azure are wrappers of Microsoft365R functions to perform some key tasks such as downloading and uploading files to Sharepoint, and downloading data from a sharepoint list. The Microsoft365R package provides a lot of functionality that leverages off the Microsoft Graph API, including the ability to create, modify and delete lists, manage SharePoint sites and many more.
