This vignette utilises the Snowflake ODBC connector via the `odbc` package, the `AzureAuth` package for Azure authentication and the `DBI` package to run queries on the connected database. These functions provide useful tools to easily connect to the Snowflake data warehouse, run SnowSQL queries and ingest data from R to snowflake.

## Setup for Snowflake connection

Setting up a connection to your Snowflake data warehouse may require a login using Azure Active Directory (now Entra ID). This can be accomplished using an Azure access token method.

Creating the snowflake token uses the az_app_id_pbi_dataflow environment variable, so no special set up is required for this. However, in order to use the token to connect to Snowflake, you have to install the [Snowflake ODBC Driver](https://developers.snowflake.com/odbc/), with further instructions on how to install and configure this available in the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/odbc/odbc-windows).

Some key settings for your Snowflake configuration dialog is as follows:

-   User: [your Active Directory user name]

-   Server: [xxxxx.australia-east.azure.snowflakecomputing.com]

-   Database: [your main Database]

-   Warehouse: [your Snowflake warehouse name]

-   Role: [your main role here]

-   Tracing(0-6): 4

-   Authenticator: oauth

The other fields may be left blank, but test your connection to see if the above settings are correct. Consult the Snowflake documentation if you run into any issues.

For the `qiverse.azure` package, the function `snowflake_con` references one environmental variable:

-   snowflake_server - "xxxxx.australia-east"

This is to be set to the first part of the server URL.

## Connecting to Snowflake

Before running any queries on Snowflake, the connection to the database needs to be established. This can be done via the `snowflake_con` function.

``` r
# Create Snowflake azure token
tk <- get_az_tk('sf')

# Establish connection to Snowflake
con <- snowflake_con(
  server_name = 'hsswa.australia-east', 
  token = tk
)
```

Using the token from `get_az_tk`, this is passed through to authenticate the connection to the Snowflake data warehouse based on the `server_name` argument.

Once connected, you are able to run any SQL code onto the Snowflake database. Please note that if your query result contains a large amount of data, this will all be downloaded to your R in-memory. This may cause some performance issues.

We can test our connection with the following code:

``` r
DBI::dbGetQuery(con, DBI::SQL("SELECT 1"))
```

A returned result indicates that the connection has been established.

## Ingesting an R table held in-memory into Snowflake

This package also includes a function to assist with ingesting in-memory R data into your Snowflake data warehouse. The `ingest_to_snowflake` function converts your data into a parquet format, initialises an empty table into Snowflake, uploads the parquet format into a staging area and then overwrites the table in Snowflake with the data.

An example use of this function is as follows:

``` r
# Create Snowflake azure token
tk <- get_az_tk('sf')

# Connect to Snowflake
con <- snowflake_con(token = tk)

# Create temporary table
temp_data <- data.frame(Alpha = c('a', 'b', 'c'), Number = 1:3)

# Ingest Example To Snowflake
ingest_to_snowflake(
  data = temp_data,
  con = con,
  database_name = 'HQIU_SANDPIT',
  schema_name = 'EXAMPLE',
  table_name = 'TEST'
)
```
